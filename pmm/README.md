# PMM Jenkins Guide

## Important directories in repo

- [CloudFormation for PMM Jenkins](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/jenkins-pipelines/tree/master/IaC/pmm.cd)
- [PMM pipelines](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/jenkins-pipelines/tree/master/pmm)
- [Jenkins variable (named helpers in this doc)](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/jenkins-pipelines/tree/master/vars)

## Agents

We build the custom image for agents and you can find Packer and Ansible files in [pmm-infra](https://github.com/percona/pmm-infra/tree/main/packer) repo.

You can use the following tags for agents:

- `agent-amd64` - short-lived agent based on Amazon Linux 2. After completing one task, the agent dies and a new one is started
- `agent-arm64` - the same as previous but arm64 arch
- `cli` - long-lived agents for tasks that do not require interaction with the file system. For example: run awc-cli command. These agents used ARM64 arch and read-only filesystem.

## Tips

### You can run Python scripts as part of pipeline

We have [runPython](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/jenkins-pipelines/blob/master/vars/runPython.groovy) helper and if you want to use it:

1. Create your Python script in [resources](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/jenkins-pipelines/tree/master/resources) directory.
2. Use `runPython('your_script_name')` or `runPython('your_script_name', 'your_scripts_args')`.

## The Zen of Jenkinsfile

1. All pipelines should be stored in this repository.
2. If your bash code is longer than 10 lines it maybe worth using Python.
3. Make sure the pipeline has an `options` block defining the number of pipeline builds Jenkins should keep, which will prevent from disk memory exhaustion. Example:

```Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
  ...
  options {
    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '10'))
  }
  ...
}
```

4. The pipelines running on long-lived agents should also clean up the working directory either on start or during the `post always` stage:

```Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
  ...
  post {
    always {
      ...
      deleteDir()
    }
  }
}
```
